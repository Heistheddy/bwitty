### Database Policies Applied

The following RLS policies ensure proper access:

```sql
-- Allow public read access to products
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read products" ON products FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Allow public read access to product images  
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read product_images" ON product_images FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Admin-only write access remains protected by existing policies
```
