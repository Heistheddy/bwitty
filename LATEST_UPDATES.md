## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Favicon Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- Old icon or no icon appears in browser tab
- Favicon doesn't update after deployment

**Solutions:**
1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data
3. **Try in incognito/private window:**
   - Bypasses cache to show current version
4. **Check browser dev tools:**
   - F12 → Network tab → Filter for "favicon"
   - Verify files are loading (200 status)

   - Browsers cache favicons aggressively
   - May take 5-10 minutes to update

### Issue 3: Reviews Not Visible
